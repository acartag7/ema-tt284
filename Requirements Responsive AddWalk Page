Requirements:
    The form should work and submit data to the TT284 reflector: http://students.open.ac.uk/mct/tt284/reflect/reflect.php. You are not required to implement any PHP to process this data at this stage.
    
    The form should include a hidden field. The field should be named ‘sessionID’ and should contain the value ‘12345678-09ab-1111-cdef’.
    
    The page should use a CSS style sheet.

    As with the wireframe, the page should be easy to use on a laptop or desktop screen (1024px wide, landscape orientation).
    
    The page and form should be accessible.
    
    The form may use HTML5 input types described in Block 2 Part 3, but validation of input data is not required at this stage.
    
    Any admin application navigation features proposed in your wireframes should be present on the page, but are not required to function.
    
    The web page and any related files should be clearly named e.g. ‘q2a.html’, ‘q2a.css’.
    
    Validate your HTML using the W3C Markup Validation Service.
    
    Use techniques you have learned in Block 3 to allow the page layout to respond to screen width, such that the page and form are also usable on a mobile device screen (375px wide, portrait orientation).
